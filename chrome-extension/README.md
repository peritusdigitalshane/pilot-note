# Prompt Marketplace Chrome Extension

Access your installed prompt packs anywhere on the web!

## Important: Icon Files Required

Before installing, you need to create placeholder icon files. Create three simple PNG images (you can use any graphic editor or online tool):

1. `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
2. `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
3. `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

Place these files in the `chrome-extension` folder. You can use a simple purple/pink gradient circle or any design you like.
